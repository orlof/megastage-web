"I have found it! The tapestry of ages is in front of me!
 Here is The Annalist's prologue we were able to decipher from
 The Ancient writing."

arrogant faces
everyman better than the one next to him
all echoing the phrases

...they lost and were all gone

Thus was the end of the first age

second age started with seeds slowly evolving in distant parts of the galaxy
remaining ancients lured in the void of time and space
many seeds came of age, but time was wrong

...until the shadow weakened
...thousands of forms awakened and with the chaos acceded the dawm of the third age
