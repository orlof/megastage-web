DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: HTA 90 (Hybrid Tracking Array)
    Version: 90
    ID: 0x3442980F
    Manufacturer: 0xE142A1FA (Ender innov.)

Description:
    This is a mixup of a standard radar detection array and a laser targeting 
    theodolite built by Ender innovations because we believe we are better at 
    building tracking systems (and anything for that matter) than anyone else 
    and not because of our inflated ego either (we consider that to be a 
    separate and unrelated issue). 

    This tracking system is built to scan for targets whether they be manmade 
    or natural and easily target and scan any one of them to get information 
    as easily as can be done with our obviously superior technology.

    Maximum detection range is 1.000.000m and sweep frequence is 1000ms.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by radar, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0 - STORE_SIGNATURES
        Copies echo signatures received with last radar sweep from internal 
        memory to 16 word area of DCPU ram starting at B. Maximum of 16 nearest 
        objects are copied. Each signature is a unique 16-bit number that is 
        never equal to 0. If the are less than 16 signatures then rest of
        signature array is filled with 0.

        Halts the DCPU-16 for 16 cycles.

    1 - SET_TRACKING_TARGET
        Sets the tracking target to the object with the signature in B.

        Returns
            C: 0xffff if target is locked
            C: 0x0000 if target locking fails 

    2 - STORE_TARGET_DATA
        Sets a 7 word area of ram starting at B to radar data of target. 

        Word 1 = type of object ( 0=unknown 1=natural 2=manmade). 
        Words 2 and 3 = [INT32] est. mass of object in kilograms (roughly 
            approximated from density and size readings. NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE!). 
            If both words 2 and 3 equal 0, then mass calculation cannot be 
            accurately ascertained. 
        Words 4 and 5 = [INT32] distance in meters between ship and target.
        Words 6 and 7 = the pitch and yaw angles between the direction of the
            target and the direction that the ship is pointing.

        Returns
            C: 0xffff if data is available
            C: 0x0000 if data is not available

        Halts the DCPU-16 for 7 cycles.

    3 - STORE_ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR
        Sets a 12 word area of ram starting at B to [ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR]
        of target in _ship's_ SOI.

        Returns register C
            0xffff Success
            0x0000 Unknown error
            0x0001 No target
            0x0002 No SOI

        Halts the DCPU-16 for 12 cycles.
